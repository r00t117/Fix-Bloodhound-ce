# Fix-Bloodhound-ce

### I have had a weird issue before where I reinstall Bloodhound CE via docker and I try to login with the temp admin password and it does not prompt me to reset the password and says access denied.

I do not have time for this on my OSCP exam nor do you. So I have a script that will find any related Bloodhound old configs and do a quick clean up to fix the docker verison of bloodhound (community edition).
